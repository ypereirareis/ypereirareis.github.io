I recently added a new service stack in my dev process with docker.
This service stack is composed of many services I can use in different projects managed with **docker-compose**.

One of those services is [mailcatcher](http://mailcatcher.me/)
and is usable with docker thanks to [this image](https://hub.docker.com/r/zolweb/docker-mailcatcher/)...
or many others.

## Docker-compose service layer

There are two ways I know to use this **mailcatcher** service inside many projetcs :

* A **mailcatcher** container for each projet (`docker-compose.yml`):

{% highlight bash %}
app:
    build: docker/app
    links:
      - mailcatcher

mailcatcher:
    image: zolweb/docker-mailcatcher
  
{% endhighlight %}

* A single **mailcatcher** container for all projects (catching all projects mails):

{% highlight bash %}
sudo docker run -d --name mailcatcher \
    zolweb/docker-mailcatcher
{% endhighlight %}

and inside your `docker-compose.yml` files :

{% highlight bash %}
app:
    build: docker/app
    external_links:
      - mailcatcher
  
{% endhighlight %}

Internally **docker** will automatically add new entry in the `/etc/hosts` file
of each container using the mailcatcher service with the targeted container IP address:

{% highlight bash %}
root@mydomain:/var/www# cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1	localhost
::1	localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0	ip6-localnet
ff00::0	ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1	ip6-allnodes
ff02::2	ip6-allrouters
172.17.0.7	mailcatcher mailcatcher_web_1
{% endhighlight %}

It allows you us to use this local domain name instead of the mailcatcher container IP address.
Useful because this IP will change each time the service container is restarted.

## The problem

Using links and external links can lead to problems.
Indeed, sometimes (do not really know why or when) the container that as dependencies on other services, **cannot** reach the local host domains at startup.

I can see two reasons for this:

* The service container is starting and the startup process of the main/app container is not finished yet.
* The application you run (apache, nginx,...) starts before the `/etc/hosts` file has been updated internally by docker.

## The solution

So far, the only solution I have to fix the problem is to wait for local domains to become reachable,
thanks to a shell script (you need netcat/nc command installed):

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ypereirareis/964cd2d2b608faa371f5.js"></script>

Use this script in the CMD section of the `Dockerfile` or in a custom startup script.

You must set an environment variable to define hosts to wait for (with a specific format HOST:PORT):

* db:3306
* mainlatcher:1080
* google.com:80

{% highlight bash %}
app:
    build: docker/app
    environment:
      WAIT_FOR_HOSTS: db:3306 mailcatcher:1080 google.com:80
    links:
      - db
    external_links:
      - mailcatcher
{% endhighlight %}

**TIPS:**

* As you can see you can wait for an outside host to become available.
* You can wait for links AND external_links.
